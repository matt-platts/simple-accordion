Simple Accordion by Matt Platts

This extremely simple jquery accordion requires the following markup:

- An outer div called 'accordion'
- Each step of the accordion to be in a 'section' tag
- The accordion header to be in an h1 tag
- The accordion content to be in a p tag

Usage:

- Add the css class 'open' to any h1 element you wish to start opened
- Add the css class 'closed' to any h1 element you wish to start closed

The script will automatically convert this to a working accordion.
