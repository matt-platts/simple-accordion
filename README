Simple Accordion by Matt Platts

This extremely simple jquery accordion requires the following markup:

- An outer div with a unique id - this is passed to the acordion function 
- Each step of the accordion, header and content item to be in a uinique HTML tag. A good example is:
  - Each step of the accordion to be in a 'section' tag
  - Each accordion header to be in an h1 tag
  - Each accordion content item to be in a p tag


The script will automatically convert this to a working accordion.

Usage:

- In your html, add the css class 'open' to any h1 element you wish to start opened (nornmally only one should be open to start)
- In your html, add the css class 'closed' to any h1 element you wish to start closed (ie all the others)
- Adjust the css as you see fit
